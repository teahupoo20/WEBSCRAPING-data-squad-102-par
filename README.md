Project Description

Stroke dataset analytics : Data analysis and hypothesis testing with linear regression. Dataset obtained from Kaggle.

This is the repo for my project for web scraping. The website is Yahoo Finance. The idea is to simplify the visual of the massive amounts of data available on the website, taking only the relevant ones for me (average user).
